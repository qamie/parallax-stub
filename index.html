        <p class="section-text">
            Vaccinating your cat against infectious diseases, as well as microchipping and neutering your cat are some of the most important aspects of cat care. While most adult felines adopted from Cats Protection will have had all three, you'll need to make sure your cat has had all necessary treatments.
            Neutering your cat is a simple operation, with many health benefits. Essential for preventing unwanted kittens and reducing the spread of disease, it is advised that owners neuter their cat from four months of age or younger.
            Microchipping is the safest and simplest way of permanently identifying your cat. The chip carries a unique ID number, allowing the cat to be traced back to you should they stray and be scanned. Keep your details updated when you move house to ensure a speedy and safe reunion.
            Kittens and adult cats should be vaccinated to help them stay healthy. Your cat will need regular vaccinations throughout their life to help keep them protected against disease.

        <h2 class="section-title">Bringing a Cat Home</h2>
        <!-- the following text will be underneath the subtitle (bringing a cat home) -->
        <p class="section-text">
            Did you know you can prepare your cat for their new home before you’ve even picked them up? Cats are heavily reliant on scent and will settle much quicker if their new environment smells familiar. To help your cat get used to your scent (and the scent of your new home), take an item of clothing or a blanket from your home and leave it with your pet for the final few days. When you pick them up, place the item in your cat’s carrier. It’ll reduce stress during the journey and help settle them in.
            Adopting a new cat or kitten is an exciting experience, although there can often be a lot to think about too. When you first take them home, you’ll need to help them gently settle into their new life. A change of environment is often stressful for a cat and it can take a few weeks for them (and you) to feel relaxed.
            The first few hours after welcoming your cat home can affect how they’ll adapt to their new life. Remember not to rush them – prepare to be patient and don’t pressure your cat into doing things they may not yet be ready for.
            Introducing a kitten to your new home is slightly different to if you were introducing a cat. Instead of leaving them on their own, provide them with a safe and secure bed at ground level – even a cardboard box will do. Once they seem settled, show them to their food bowls, water bowls, scratching post and bed.

        <h2 class="section-title">Cat Behaviour</h2>
        <!-- the following text will be underneath the subtitle (cat behaviour) -->
        <p class="section-text">
            Some of the typical cat behaviours that we don't like are actually perfectly normal, while others indicate that your cat is stressed, scared, sick or in pain. Punishing your cat will only make these problems worse. If your cat starts doing something new, different or out of character, this could be their way of telling you that something is wrong. Medical disorders often cause behavioural changes. You should take your cat to the vet as soon as they exhibit different behaviours and discuss your cat's behaviour and your concerns with the vet. Cats are good at hiding their pain, so it can be hard to tell if they're suffering. Instead of limping, for example, they might show slight changes in their behaviour or mood. There are many different medical problems that cause discomfort and varying intensities of pain. If you notice any change in your cat's behaviour, lifestyle or interactions, take them to the vet for a health check. By treating pain you can greatly improve their quality of life.

            <p class="section-text">
                How much your cat eats (and how much you should feed them) will depend on their current circumstances, such as their age and weight. If you’re ever unsure about how much your cat should be eating, speak to your vet as they can give you the best advice based on your cat’s needs. There will usually be a guide on your cat’s food as to how much you should be feeding them. Remember this is only a rough guide and will depend on your cat’s current weight. Your vet will be able to tell you exactly how much you should feed your cat. Head to your nearest supermarket’s pet food aisle and you’ll find plenty of cat foods to choose from. But with so much on offer, how can you decide what is best for your cat?

                Before you buy, remember to choose food specially formulated for cats. Dog food isn’t suitable and food intended for humans doesn’t necessarily include all the nutrients that your cat needs. The best food for your cat (unless they have special dietary needs) is a complete cat food from a reputable brand.
                
                Homemade cat foods might be good for occasional treats, but it is very difficult to give your cat the right balance of proteins, vitamins and minerals they need to thrive – unless this has been recommended by your vet.
                Cats should be drinking water every day to stay happy and healthy. There’s nothing else your cat should be drinking. You should make sure your cat has a source of clean, fresh water all the time (even if they do sometimes prefer drinking from puddles).
                For a lot of people, when we think of cats we might think of a big bowl of milk in front of them, but in reality cats don’t need milk to stay healthy. In fact, milk will do the exact opposite for your cat. Many cats are lactose intolerant which means that milk can upset their stomach. For the sake of your cat’s health and waistline, it’s best just to stick to water as part of their balanced diet. You should never give your cat cow’s milk or any kind of milk substitute (for example, oat milks or nut milks) as they can make them very poorly. Around a third of cats cannot have cow’s milk as it upsets their tummy because they struggle to digest it and a lot of alternative milks are made from things that could even be toxic to your cat.
